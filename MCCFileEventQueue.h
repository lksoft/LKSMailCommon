//  Based almost entirely on VDKQueue by Bryan D K Jones & UKKQueue by Uli Kusterer
//
//
//  IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ATOMIC OPERATIONS (Copied from VDKQueue's header file)
//
//      There are two ways of saving a file on OS X: Atomic and Non-Atomic. In a non-atomic operation, a file is saved by directly overwriting it with new data.
//      In an Atomic save, a temporary file is first written to a different location on disk. When that completes successfully, the original file is deleted and the
//      temporary one is renamed and moved into place where the original file existed.
//
//      This matters a great deal. If you tell MCCFileEvent to watch file X, then you save file X ATOMICALLY, you'll receive a notification about that event. HOWEVER, you will
//      NOT receive any additional notifications for file X from then on. This is because the atomic operation has essentially created a new file that replaced the one you
//      told MCCFileEvent to watch. (This is not an issue for non-atomic operations.)
//
//      To handle this, any time you receive a change notification from MCCFileEvent, you should call -removePath: followed by -addPath: on the file's path, even if the path
//      has not changed. This will ensure that if the event that triggered the notification was an atomic operation, MCCFileEvent will start watching the "new" file that took
//      the place of the old one.
//
//      Other frameworks out there try to work around this issue by immediately attempting to re-open the file descriptor to the path. This is not bulletproof and may fail;
//      it all depends on the timing of disk I/O. Bottom line: you could not rely on it and might miss future changes to the file path you're supposedly watching. That's why
//      MCCFileEvent does not take this approach, but favors the "manual" method of "stop-watching-then-rewatch".
//
